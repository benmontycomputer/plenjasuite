First: comment out the "import" statements that use files in the source directory
	(ex: "import headerbar", "import settings").

Next: uncomment the line below "# use this for production" so that the files
	in /usr/lib/python3.xx/site-packages/plenjabrowser are used.
	An error will be thrown if this is not done.

Next: run "./compile.sh"

Next: copy the compiled browser to the required directory.

Next: copy all the other python files used by the program 
	into the site-packages/plenjabrowser directory,
	wherever that is.
	Ex: /package/source/package/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/plenjabrowser/

Finally: copy all files that belong in "/etc/plenja/browser" to where they
	need to go for the package.
